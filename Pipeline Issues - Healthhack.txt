List of issues with my pipeline/Rubra/Ruffus


- the way that different Ruffus decorators use different ways of matching input files is 
a bit annoying. 
For example, @transform can take suffix, regex or formatter matches
@collate can only take regex or formatter matches
@merge can only take tasks or file names (with no matches?)
This makes it hard to link jobs effectively 


# I don't know how to specify a list of input files to the 'merge' decorator so that it 
# will also be output as a list of files for the actual command. This is a problem in my 
# stages called 'realignIntervals','realign' and 'freebayes1' (both in the config file and the pipeline file)
FIXED

- currently I have some commands using Popoolation2 hard-coded to use the Popoolation2 
python scripts from my user directory instead of loading the appropriate module.
I can't remember why this was - whether I couldn't get the module to load properly or 
whether I was impatient about getting the help desk admin people to install the program
as a module. Anyway, I should replace this with using the module.


# apparently for some reason I also hard-coded the Picard tools to use scripts
#  from my user directory. Currently trying to update this... 
FIXED

- The pipeline fails to make the fastq_symlinks directory if a relative path is 
specified instead of a full path, and just throws this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/vlsci/VR0339/pgriffin/rubra_dev/bin/rubra", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('Rubra==0.1.5', 'console_scripts', 'rubra')()

    os.mkdir(dir, 0777)
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/pipeline_output/fastq_symlinks'

the error message is quite opaque so this requirement could be described somewhere


- It seems that the pipeline needs a step to create the output directory
I've added this in the pipeline.py file

- in the 'print' output for the very first step, I get a warning:
Job Warning: File match failure: File '/vlsci/VR0339/pgriffin/pipeline_output/fastq_symlinks/C2_C2PUNACXX_L1_2.fastq.gz' does not match regex('(.+\/)?(.+?)\_1.fastq\.gz') and pattern '\1\2_2.fastq.gz'
However surely the symlinks that were created should match the expected format??

- for some reason I end up with duplicate fastq symlinks. I think this means
  the pipeline is running twice as many jobs as it needs to... e.g.

Symlinked files that will be used:

- I have included a flag ('restrict_samples') to use either the raw or the trimmed 
fastq files as input. 
(in practice, you want to use the raw files as input to FastQC and Trimmomatic, and then 
the trimmed fastq files as input to all the following stages)
However this is probably very messily and tenuously coded and could be improved. It is 
located in the pipeline.py file (lines 84-99) and implemented in the pipeline_config.py 
file (in the command-line default specifications at the end of the file)

- Also, currently the pipeline searches for the trimmed fastq files right at the start - 
i.e. before they've actually been created - and I have to comment out the bits that 
mention them (in the pipeline.py file) to be able to even run the first step of the pipeline.

- The way I've specified the trimmed files doesn't exclude files ending in
  'unpaired-trimmed.fastq.gz' (which it should) so I have to manually move
those files out of the trimmed directory

- I would like to run a summary tool after every stage as a default option and have this 
somehow integrated into the stage, rather than having to specify it as a separate stage 
(perhaps the latter part is not realistic though)

- the regex matching is really hard... is there some way to simplify this? e.g. write
some functions to translate "file ends with .fastq.gz" into regex?

- There is something missing from the rubra utils file perhaps? 
When trying to 'print' I first get the error

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/vlsci/VR0339/pgriffin/rubra_dev/bin/rubra", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('Rubra==0.1.5', 'console_scripts', 'rubra')()

    __import__(drop_py_suffix(args.pipeline))
  File "pipeline.py", line 39, in <module>
    from input_fastq import parse_and_link
ImportError: No module named input_fastq

and I found that I had previously had 'input_fastq.py' as a separate file in the same
directory where the rest of the pipeline files were located.
